  behavior of "Character"

  it should "Start with 1000 hitpoints by default" in {
    thrud.hitPoints shouldBe HitPoints(1000)
  }

  it should "start alive by default" in {
    thrud.alive shouldBe Alive
  }


  behavior of "takeing damage"

  it should "receive damage" in {
    thrud.damage(hp100) shouldBe thrud900HitPoints
    thrud200HitPoints.damage(hp100) shouldBe thrud100HitPoints

  }
  behavior of "receiving negative damage"

  it should "ignore -ve damage" in {
    thrud200HitPoints.damage(hpMinus100) shouldBe thrud200HitPoints
  }

  behavior of "Death"

  it should "die if damage received takes it negative" in {
    thrud100HitPoints.damage(hp900) shouldBe deadThrud
  }

  behavior of "LogData for character"

  it should "have a decent string" in {
    implicitly[LogData[Character]] apply thrud shouldBe "Thrud is alive: Alive with 1000"
  }

  behavior of "Logging for character"

  it should "call the logging function" in {
    val (x, msg) = valueAndLog(thrud.damage(hp100))
    msg.trim shouldBe "Damaged Thrud is alive: Alive with 900"

  }
